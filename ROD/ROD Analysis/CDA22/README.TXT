CHAOS DATA ANALYZER: The Professional Version is published by the 
American Institute of Physics as part of a continuing series of 
software from Physics Academic Software.  The software package includes 
a User's Manual for the PC computer.

STARTING THE PROGRAM
To start the program, type START and press <Enter>.  Alternatively, you 
may type CDA and press <Enter>. 

OVERVIEW
CHAOS DATA ANALYZER is a collection of 19 programs that allow you to 
analyze a record of up to 32,000 data points representing some quantity 
measured at equally spaced intervals.  If the interval is a time, the 
method is referred to as time-series analysis, and the record is 
typical of what one might display on an oscilloscope or chart recorder.  

The major goal of CHAOS DATA ANALYZER is to detect hidden determinism 
(chaos) in random-looking data.  Where chaos is found to exist, tools 
are provided to determine properties of the equations underlying the 
behavior and to predict the next few values in the time series.  You 
can also use the program as a lecture demonstration tool or student 
tutorial in a course on nonlinear dynamics.  

The data are read from a disk file that is provided by the user or 
produced by the companion program CHAOS DEMONSTRATIONS.  Sample data 
files are included with the program. 

All the commands are entered by single keystrokes or by single clicks 
of the mouse.  CHAOS DATA ANALYZER is written to make it easy for you 
to move from one analysis program to the next.  It has an automatic 
mode in which all the tests are performed in sequence and, a summary 
of the results is provided. 

COMPUTER SYSTEM
Your computer system and hardware configuration should be a PC 
computer with the following features: 

          1. CGA, MCGA, EGA, or VGA graphics
          2. Minimum memory of 512K
          3. DOS 3.0 or higher
          4. Math coprocessor (recommended)
          5. Mouse (optional)
          6. Printer with graphics capability (recommended)
